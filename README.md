# A Pose Estimator based on YOLO and Ultralytics
This repository hosts a Pose Estimator project developed using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and the Ultralytics framework, designed as part of a Machine Learning course at MFT. The project focuses on accurately detecting and estimating human poses in real-time by leveraging the power of YOLO's object detection capabilities combined with advanced pose estimation techniques.
